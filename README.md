# To-do Web Application

Create create a Todo List web application with user authentication features. Users should be able to sign up for an account, log in, and manage their tasks.
Instead of a backend server and database, I used local storage to simulate user accounts

## Features

#### 1. User Authentication :

```
- Implement user registration (signup) and login functionality.

- Users should be able to sign up with a username and password.

- Users should be able to log in with their credentials.

- Use forms for both registration and login.
```

#### 2. Authentication State :

```
- Manage user authentication state using React state.

- Implement protected routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts
  of the application (e.g., the todo list).
```

#### 3. Task Management :
```
- Users should be able to create, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

- Tasks should be associated with the logged-in user.

- Tasks should persist in local storage, so they are not lost on page refresh.
```

#### 4. Logout :
```
 - Implement a logout button that allows users to log out of their accounts.
```

#### 5. User Interface :
```
- Create an intuitive user interface with a clean design for both the authentication and todo list
  parts of the application.

- Display a list of tasks, each with options to edit, mark as completed, and delete.
```

#### 6. Error Handling :
```
- Provide user-friendly error messages for scenarios such as incorrect login credentials, registration errors, or failed task updates.

- Security Considerations:
```

#### 7. User-Specific Data :
```
- Ensure that each user can only see and manage their own tasks after logging in.

- Tasks should be associated with the user who created them.
```
